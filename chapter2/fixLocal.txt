fixing draft locality and continuity

x Instead of 2.3.2 Intrinsic properties, call it

- Neighborhood convolution

x And put it in 2.3.3 (EC* as 2.3.2)

x (weight sharing moved to EC*)

\rho^{-1}: v \mapsto g_v^{-1}(u) = x

rho(x) = v

etc

(NB) conv
iff g_v are graphs aut that are simple transitive actions of a group \Gamma
iff right cayley graph of group \Gamma

(EC-NB) conv iff right CG = left CG iff \Gamma is abelian iff abelian cayley subgraph isomorphism

x For groupoids and partial conv, say we do conjecture for same EC-NB, (they are EV anyway), where NB means restriction of a graph automorphism.

x For path groupoids: extends p_v(p_u)

x For path groupoids, explain (EC = N) if possible
