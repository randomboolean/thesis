Defining a convolution of signals over graph domains is a challenging problem. If the graph is not a grid graph, there exists no natural extension of the Euclidean convolution. In \secref{sec:2.1}, we analyze the reasons why the Euclidean convolution operator is useful in deep learning. In particular, we recall a classical characterization: that convolution operators are exactly the class of linear functions that are equivariant to translations (\thref{prop:equi}). Therefore, we then search for domains onto which a convolution with these properties can be naturally obtained. This leads us to put our interest on representation theory and convolutions defined on groups. Since the Euclidean convolution is just a particular case of the group convolution, it makes perfect sense to steer our construction in this direction. In \secref{sec:2.2}, we seek to transfer the definition of the group convolution onto the vertex domain, through its symmetric group. We do not obtain the wanted characterization with a simple homomorphism condition (\propref{prop:equiV}). However, we manage to obtain it should we fix an equivariant mapping between a subgroup of the symmetric group and the vertex domain (\thref{prop:equiG}). Then, we propose a mixed formulation of this convolution as a binary operation between a signal defined on the vertex domain and a signal defined on its corresponding subgroup, for which we demonstrate that the characterization holds under abelianity (\thref{cor:equiM}). In \secref{sec:edges}, we introduce the role of the edge set and see how it influences the construction. In particular, we obtain a characterization of graphs that admit a natural construction by Cayley subgraph isomorphism (\thref{th:cayleychar}). We analyze the notions of locality and weight sharing in this construction, and give a formulation for small kernels. Then, in \secref{sec:2.4}, we relax some aspect of the construction to adapt it to general graphs. We explain why a construction based on groups fails for general graphs, and introduce the notion of groupoid. We extend the previous construction with groupoids of partial transformations, and prove that the characterization is preserved (\thref{prop:equiP}). Finally, we extend it another time with another type of groupoid, that we call path groupoids. Path groupoids allows to tackle the more general case, and for them we obtain the characterization should we fix a way to traverse the vertex set using a subset of the edge set (\thref{th:equiU}). We summarize our constructions in a conclusive \secref{sec:2.5}. The result of this chapter is the obtention of a set of general expressions and theorems that describe convolutions of graph signals.
