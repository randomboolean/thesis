We introduce Cayley convolution, a convolution operation that can be constructed on any domain, which extends the definition of the classical Dirichlet convolution. Cayley convolutions are named after Cayley graphs which are generated from a well chosen subset of the transformation group of the input domain. In particular, using Cayley convolutions make sense on graph domains characterized by transformations constrained on their edges, and they can conversely exhibit a Cayley graph structure out of any domain.
