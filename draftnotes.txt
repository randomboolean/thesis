# Draft of plan for chapter 2:
#

2.1 Analysis of the classical convolution
    -1 Constraints (C1 up to C3 + C0 verified by groupoids)
    Just let out groupoids for now

2.2 Representation theory of generalized convolutions
    -1 Conditions for constraints (about C2 and C3, while C0 is checked and C1 is not)

2.3 Cayley Graphs (from groups to Cayley graphs)
    -1 Examples of Cayley graphs
      Lattices, lattice-regular, Circulant graphs, product graphs ...

2.4 Construction based on symmetries
talk about complexity to find symmetries : ie impossible NP hard
and send it to 3.

2.5 and 2.4 together ?

2.5 Construction based on partial symmetries
    Groupoids
    Abelianity
    Bastnet (just theory, the approximations from bastien paper come in 3.)
Groupoids on cayley graphs ?

Pooling and architectures comes in 3.
As well as the connectivity matrix formulation (with figure).

Need to write
