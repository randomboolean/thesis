chapter 2 plans ? Convolution on graph domains


2.1 Analysis of the classical convolution
2.1.1 properties
2.1.2 characterization
2.1.3 usefulness in deep learning
2.2 Methodology for extending convolutions
2.2.1 Extension

NOPE. Think I'd rather stick with the first


edges -> talk about automorphism

maybe

2.1 Analysis of the classical convolution

2.2 Representation theory of generalized convolutions

2.3 Inclusion of automorphic constraints
2.3.1 Automorphisms
2.3.2 vertex / arc-transitive graphs
2.3.3 Cayley graphs
2.3.4 characterization other sens

2.4 From automorphic to injective and morphic
2.4.1 Groupoids
2.4.2 abelianity
etc
