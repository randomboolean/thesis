In this manuscript, we built a theory for convolutions on graphs, in view of using them in CNN on graph domains. On enclidean domains, convolutional layers takes advantage of the translational equivariances of the convolution. Therefore, our construction on graph domains depends on a set of transformations of the vertex set for which the resulting operation is also equivariant. More precisely, we wanted to define a class of convolutional operators that are exactly the class of linear operators that are equivariant to this set of transformation. We demonstrated that this characterization is preserved should this set have a structure of a group, a groupoid or a path groupoid. In particular, we proved that this amounts to search for Cayley subgraphs. We also exposed the role of the abelianity of these strucures, in that the resulted convolution remains locally supported as the set is traversed.


%As a whole, we hope that our research have help in advancing
