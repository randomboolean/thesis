Manuscript

o Gilles suggestions on chap 1
o Vincent suggestions on chap 2
o section Genericity of ternary include GCN, GAT
o name ternary operator "neural contraction" and do related changes
o explain GAT
x dataset subsection 1.3.2bis

o intro of 1
? maybe conclusion of 1
x intro of 3
x conclusion of 3
? refactoring of 3.3 into two subsections?
x global intro
x global conclusion
x 3.4.3 connection with chapter 2

x write MCnet 3.2.4
? write 3.2.5
? write 3.3.6
? write 3.3.7
x write 3.3.8

x fix left and right cayley
x fix path convolution
x rewrite intro2: motivation, then plan. Talk about eq linear class
x connection between chap2 and literature ie chebnet, vertex etc.
x upgrade some proposition as theorems

x fill in placeholder figures and \todo{}
? schema Cayley graph characterization 2.3.1
? Pass on bib files, and add venues instead of arxiv when relevant
? Change book style

Experiments

p 3.2.4 MCnet -> try simpler MC -> (1) Give big weights to self (2) softmax (3) comparison with non graph uniform random
d 3.2.5 kipf directed graph w=2 -> can't find same split
? 3.2.5 split graphs, multiple graphs (eg N graphs of same LRF size)
? 3.3.6 deep by reusing S from shallow, or from noisy auto-enc
? 3.3.7 shallow on Pines
x 3.3.8 learning A kipf with multiple heads
? maybe add industrial exp if any time left ...
