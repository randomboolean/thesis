Manuscript

o Gilles suggestions on chap 1
o Vincent suggestions on chap 2
o section Genericity of ternary include GCN, GAT
o name ternary operator "neural contraction" and do related changes
o explain GAT
o dataset subsection 1.3.2bis

o intro of 1
d maybe conclusion of 1
o intro of 3
? conclusion of 3 (with limitations)
o refactoring of 3.3 into two subsections?
o global intro
o abstract
o global conclusion
o rewrite intro 2

x fix left and right cayley
x fix path convolution
d connection between chap2 and literature ie chebnet, vertex etc.
o upgrade some proposition as theorems

o 3.4.3 connection with chapter 2
o write MCnet 3.2.4
d write 3.2.5
d write 3.3.6
d write 3.3.7 (very optional)
o write 3.3.8
o a word on GAT and 3.3.8

o fill in placeholder figures (have been commented out for the moment)
o complete \todo{}
x check figure placements
? schema Cayley graph characterization 2.3.1
? Pass on bib files, and add venues instead of arxiv when relevant
o Change book style
? improve style, add snake decorations and lettrines

x rewrite general conclusion
x rewrite conclusion of 2 or remove
? write conclusion of 3
x update chapter overviews

Experiments

o 3.2.4 MCnet -> try simpler MC -> (1) Give big weights to self (2) softmax (3) comparison with non graph uniform random
d 3.2.5 kipf directed graph w=2 -> can't find same split
d 3.2.5 split graphs, multiple graphs (eg N graphs of same LRF size)
? 3.3.6 deep by reusing S from shallow, or from noisy auto-enc
d 3.3.7 shallow on Pines (very optional)
o 3.3.8 learning A kipf with multiple heads
d maybe add industrial exp if any time left ...
