0) representation of a tensor contraction (propagational point of view)
0b) tensor theory of graphs

On convolutions on graphs:
1) tensor-train or other tensor decompositions to accelerat SWX
2) graph product (approximate) factorization (to make nd convolutions)
3) decomposition of general graphs into circulant graphs
4) shifts
