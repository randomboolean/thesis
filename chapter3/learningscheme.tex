\section{Learning the weight sharing scheme}
\label{sec:learningscheme}

\subsection{Discussion}

In the ternary representation $Y = h(\wideparen{\Theta S X})$ of a layer~$\cl$, the weight kernel~$\Theta$ is usually the only operand that is learned, and the role of~$S$ is to label the edges of the propagation graph~$P$ with these weights. Recall that, as noted after \defref{def:ter}, $S$ needs not be sparse and composed of one-hot vectors. In that case, the labelling is done linearly as depicted previously in \figref{fig:ternary}. Therefore, the weight sharing scheme $S$ can also be updated during the learning phase. This can be interpreted as learning a convolution-like operator on the underlying graph~$G$~\citep{vialatte2017learning}.

\begin{remark}
When $S$ doesn't have the sparse priors mentioned in \secref{sec:sparse}, we must not have more parameters in $S$ and $\Theta$ than in $W$, so that the weight sharing still makes sense. If we call $l$ the number of edges in the resulting propagation graph $P$, then the former assumption requires $l\omega + \omega NM \leq lNM$ or equivalently $\frac{1}{\omega} \geq \frac{1}{NM} + \frac{1}{l}$. It implies that the number of weights per filter $\omega$ must be lower than the total number of filters $NM$ and than the number of edges $l$, which is always the case in practice.
\end{remark}

%However, as learning $S$ will require in most cases to lose the sparse priors, this can lead to memory issues and increased time execution. Hence, our first experiments focus on shallow architectures to study feasability. Despite these limitations, the observations could still be useful to understand better the extent of the ternary representation. Nonetheless, these experiments can also see application in deep settings: an approach would be to pick a weight sharing scheme $S$ learned in shallow settings and to share it among ternary representations of convolutional layers of a deep architecture.

\subsection{Experimental settings}
In our experiments, we learn the scheme $S$ and the kernel $\Theta$ simultaneously.

\paragraph{Constraints for supervised classification of graph signals}

Because of our inspiration from CNNs, we propose constraints on the parameters of $S$. Namely, we impose them to be between~$0$ and~$1$, and to sum to~$1$ along the first rank (the rank that is contracted in the product~$\Theta S$).
\begin{gather}
\forall (k,i,j),~S[k,i,j] \in [0,1]\\
\forall (i,j),~\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\omega S[k,i,j] = 1
\end{gather}

Therefore, the vectors on the first rank of $S$ can be interpreted as performing a positive weighted average of the parameters in $\Theta$.
Also, we choose to aim our study at graph signals. Hence, we consider a graph $\gve$ and that the layer is EC. For this reason, \propref{prop:aw} tells us that the connectivity matrix~$W$ of the layer is masked by the adjacency matrix~$A$. Therefore, $S$ is also masked by~$A$ \ie we impose the constraint that
\begin{gather}
A[i,j] = 0 \Rightarrow \forall k, S[k,i,j] = 0
\end{gather}

\paragraph{Constraints for semi-supervised classification of nodes}

For the case of citation networks, we consider only one graph and thus we set $\omega = 1$ so that $S$ and $\Theta$ are matrices. Additionaly, we impose rows of the scheme $S$ to be normalized so that each node receives a normalized information from its neighborhood. In our experiments, we choose to use softmax normalization because it is of standard usage (but other normalizations could do as well).

\paragraph{Name}
In \citep{vialatte2017learning}, we used the term \emph{Local Receptive Graph layers}, since \propref{prop:lrf} relates $G$ with local receptive fields defined by $W$. However it was cumbersome so in this manuscript we will just call them \emph{Graph Contraction Layer} in reference to the neural contraction (see \defref{def:ter}). We call \emph{Graph Contraction Networks} (GCT) the corresponding neural networks.

\paragraph{Initialization}
In supervised settings, we introduce three types of initialization for the scheme $S$. The last two have the sparse priors mentioned in \secref{sec:sparse}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item uniform random: parameters of $S$ are simply initialized with a uniform random distribution with limits as described by \cite{glorot2010understanding}.
  \item random one-hot: one-hot vectors are distributed randomly on the $S[:,i,j]$, with the constraint that for each LRF, a particular one-hot vector can only be distributed at most once more than any other.
  \item circulant one-hot: one-hot vectors are distributed in a circulant fashion on the $S[:,i,j]$, so that on euclidean domains, the initial state of $S$ correspond exactly to the weight sharing scheme of a standard convolution.
\end{enumerate}

In semi-supervised settings, we initialize the scheme $S$ using the normalized adjacency matrix $\widetilde{A}$ to which we add a gaussian noise $\cn(0,\sigma)$, where the standard deviation $\sigma$ is determined following \cite{glorot2010understanding}.

\subsection{Experiments with grid graphs}

We experiment GCTs on the MNIST dataset (see \secref{sec:datasets}). We use a shallow architecture made of a single ternary layer with 50 feature maps, without pooling, followed by a fully connected layer of 300 neurons, and terminated by a softmax layer of 10 neurons. ReLu activations~\citep{glorot2011deep} are used and a dropout~\citep{srivastava2014dropout} of 0.5 is applied on the fully-connected layer. Input layers are regularized by a factor weight of $10^{-5}$~\citep{ng2004feature}. We optimize with ADAM~\citep{kingma2014adam} up to 100 epochs and fine-tune (while $S$ is frozen) for up to 50 additional epochs.

For the underlying graph strucure, we consider a grid graph that connects each pixel to itself and its 4 nearest neighbors (or less on the borders). We also consider the square of this graph (pixels are connected to their 13 nearest neighbors, including themselves), the cube of this graph (25 nearest neighbors), up to 10 powers (211 nearest neighbors).
We test the model under two setups: either the ordering of the node is unknown, and then we use random one-hot intialization for $S$; either an ordering of the node is known, and then we use circulant one-hot intialization for $S$ which we freeze in this state. We use the number of nearest neighbors as for the dimension of the first rank of $S$.
We also compare with a convolutional layer of size 5x5, thus containing as many weights as the cube of the grid graph. On MNIST, training architectures that learn $S$ took about twice longer. Table~\ref{toy} summarizes the obtained results. The ordering is unknown for the first result given, and known for the second result between parenthesis.

\begin{table}[H]
  \caption{Error rates on powers of the grid graphs on MNIST.}
  \begin{center}
    \bgroup
    \def\arraystretch{1.5}%  1 is the default, change whatever you need
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      Conv5x5 & Grid$^1$ & Grid$^2$ & Grid$^3$\\
      \hline
      (0.87\%) & 1.24\% (1.21\%) & 1.02\% (0.91\%) & 0.93\% (0.91\%)\\
      \hline
      \hline
      Grid$^4$ & Grid$^5$ & Grid$^6$ & Grid$^{10}$\\
      \hline
      0.90\% (0.87\%) & 0.93\% (0.80\%) & 1.00\% (0.74\%) & 0.93\% (0.84\%)\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \egroup
  \end{center}
  \label{toy}
\end{table}

We observe that even without knowledge of the underlying euclidean structure, grid GCTs obtain comparable performances as CNNs, and when the ordering is known, they match them. We also noticed that after training, even though the one-hot vectors used for initialization had changed to floating point values, their most significant dimension was almost always the same. That suggests there is room to improve the initialization and the optimization.

In Figure~\ref{functionofepoch}, we plot the test error rate for various normalizations when using the square of the grid graph, as a function of the number of epochs of training, only to find that they have little influence on the performance but sometimes improve it a bit. Thus, we will treat them as optional hyperparameters.

  \caption{Evolution of the test error rate when learning MNIST using the square of a grid graph and for various normalizations, as a function of the epoch of training. The legend reads: ``l2'' means $\ell_2$ normalization of weights is used (with weights $10^{-5}$), ``Pos'' means parameters in $S$ are forced to being positive, and ``Norm'' means that the $\ell_1$ norm of each vector in the third dimension of $S$ is forced to 1.}
  \label{functionofepoch}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Experiments with covariance graphs}

As underlying graph structure, we use a thresholded covariance matrix obtained by using all the training examples. We choose the threshold so that the number of remaining edges corresponds to a certain density $p$ (5x5 convolutions correspond approximately to a density of $p=3\%$). We also infer a graph based on the $k$ nearest neighbors of the inverse of the values of this covariance matrix ($k$-NN). The latter two are using no prior about the signal underlying structure. The pixels of the input images are shuffled and the same re-ordering of the pixels is used for every image. Dimension of the first rank of $S$ is chosen equal to $k$ and its weights are initialized random uniformly.
GCTs are also compared with models obtained when replacing the first layer by a fully connected or convolutional one. Architecture used is the same as in the previous section. Results are reported on table~\ref{covar}.

\begin{table}[H]
  \caption{Error rates when topology is unknown on scrambled MNIST.}
  \begin{center}
    \bgroup
    \def\arraystretch{1.5}%  1 is the default, change whatever you need
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      MLP & Conv5x5 & Thresholded ($p=3\%$) & $k$-NN ($k=25$)\\
      \hline
      1.44\% & 1.39\% & 1.06\% & 0.96\%\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \egroup
  \end{center}
  \label{covar}
  \end{table}

We observe that GCTs outperform the CNN and the MLP on scrambled MNIST. This is remarkable because that suggests it has been able to exploit information about the underlying structure thanks to its underlying graph.

\subsection{Improved convolutions on shallow architectures}

On CIFAR-10 (see \secref{sec:datasets}), we made experiments on shallow CNN architectures and replaced convolutions by receptive graphs. We report results on a variant of AlexNet~\citep{krizhevsky2012imagenet} using little distortion on the input that we borrowed from a tutorial of tensorflow~\citep{tensorflow2015-whitepaper}.
%On Cifar10, we use a variant of the AlexNet architecture applied on inputs with little distortion~\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}, borrowed from a tutorial of tensorflow~\cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper}.
It is composed of two 5x5 convolutional layers of 64 feature maps, with max pooling and local response normalization, followed by two fully connected layers of 384 and 192 neurons.
On CIFAR-10, training architectures that learn $S$ took about $2.5$ times longer.
%We switched each convolutional layer with receptive graph layers, but kept the pooling ones.
We compare two different graph supports: the one obtained by using the underlying graph of a regular 5x5 convolution, and the support of the square of the grid graph. Optimization is done with stochastic gradient descent on 375 epochs where $S$ is freezed on the 125 last ones. Circulant one-hot intialization is used. These are weak classifiers for CIFAR-10 but they are enough to analyse the usefulness of the proposed layer.
%Exploring deeper architectures is left for further work.
Experiments are run five times each. Means and standard deviations of accuracies are reported in table~\ref{cifar}. ``Pos'' means parameters in $S$ are forced to being positive, ``Norm'' means that the $\ell_1$ norm of each vector in the third dimension of $S$ is forced to 1, ``Both'' means both constraints are applied, and ``None'' means none are used.

\begin{table}[H]

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      Support & Learn $S$ & None & Pos & Norm & Both\\
      \hline
      \hline
      Conv5x5 & No & / & / & / & $86.8 \pm 0.2$\\
      \hline
      Conv5x5 & Yes & $87.4 \pm 0.1$ & $87.1 \pm 0.2$ & $87.1 \pm 0.2$ & $87.2 \pm 0.3$\\
      \hline
      Grid$^2$ & Yes & $87.3 \pm 0.2$ & $87.3 \pm 0.1$ & $87.5 \pm 0.1$ & $87.4 \pm 0.1$\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \egroup
  \end{center}
  \label{cifar}
\end{table}

The GCTs are able to outperform the corresponding CNNs by a small by statistically significant amount in a shallow architecture.

Learning the scheme $S$ imply a memory overhead due to the increase in the number of weights of each layer, thus why we limited this experiments to shallow architectures. An example of strategy to extend this experiment to deeper architectures is to tie the schemes of each layer together, or to reuse a same scheme (previously learned) for all layers.
